What Redox is
=============

Redox is a general purpose operating system and surrounding ecosystem written in pure Rust. Our aim is to provide a fully functioning Unix-like microkernel, that is both secure and free.

We have modest compatibility with POSIX, allowing Redox to run many programs without porting.

We take inspiration from Plan9, Minix, Linux, and BSD. We are trying to generalize various concepts from other systems, to get one unified design. We will speak about this some more in the `Design` chapter.

Redox runs on real hardware today.

This book is broken into 8 parts:

- Overview: A quick'n'dirty overview of Redox.
- Introduction: Explanation of what Redox is and how it compares to other systems.
- Getting started: Compiling and running Redox.
- The design: An in-depth introduction to the design and implementation of Redox.
- Development in user space: Writing applications for Redox.
- Contributing: How you can contribute to Redox.
- Understanding the codebase: For familiarizing yourself with the codebase.
- Fun: Top secret chapter.
- The future: What Redox aims to be.

It is written such that you do not need any prior knowledge in Rust and/or OS development.
