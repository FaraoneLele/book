### Chat
The quickest and most open way to communicate with the Redox team is on our chat server, powered with [Mattermost](https://about.mattermost.com/).  
Currently, the only way to join it is by sending an email to [info@redox-os.org](mailto:info@redox-os.org), which might take a little while, since it's not automated. We're currently working on an easier way to do this, but this is the most convenient way right now.

### IRC
You can also communicate with the Redox team using IRC, on the `#redox` channel - note that we are less present on IRC than the Chat.
